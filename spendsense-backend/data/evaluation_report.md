## Results Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Coverage | 100.00% | 100% | PASS |
| Explainability | 100.00% | 100% | PASS |
| Latency | 0.0026s | <5s | PASS |
| Auditability | 100.00% | 100% | PASS |

## Coverage Details

- Users with assigned persona: 50/50
- Users with >=3 signal categories: 50/50

Coverage measures whether each user receives meaningful analysis. A user has coverage if:
1. They have an assigned persona (not "consent_required" or "balanced" fallback without signals)
2. At least 3 of the 4 signal categories (credit, income, savings, subscriptions) have data

## Explainability Details

- Recommendations with explanation text: 150/150
- Recommendations with key signals: 150/150

Every recommendation includes a "because" rationale that cites specific data points from the user's
financial profile. This ensures transparency in why each piece of content was selected.

## Latency Details

| Percentile | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Min | 0.0016s |
| P50 (Median) | 0.0019s |
| P95 | 0.0025s |
| P99/Max | 0.0362s |
| **Average** | **0.0026s** |

Recommendation generation completes well under the 5-second target, ensuring responsive user experience.

## Auditability Details

- Recommendations with complete decision trace: 150/150

A complete decision trace includes: persona type, confidence score, explanation text, key signals list,
and content/offer ID. This enables full reconstruction of why each recommendation was made.

## Relevance Score Distribution

| Score | Count | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | 0 | Excellent match |
| 4 | 150 | Very good match |
| 3 | 0 | Good match |
| 2 | 0 | Fair match |
| 1 | 0 | Poor match |

Average relevance score: **4.00/5**

## Fairness Analysis

Fairness concerns: One persona dominates (100.0% of users); Multiple personas underrepresented: variable_income, debt_consolidator, subscription_heavy, savings_builder

### Persona Distribution

| Persona | Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------|------------|
| high_utilization | 50 | 100.0% |

**Entropy**: 0.0000 (higher = more evenly distributed)
